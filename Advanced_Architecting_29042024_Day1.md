**QUESTIONS**:

**a) What is the charge for having EC2 on Outposts?**

R:/ According to [AWS Questions on Repost](https://repost.aws/questions/QU5UM3emo5R4ypbOElxg4dQA/is-the-pricing-of-using-services-in-outpost-the-same-as-using-on-cloud) and [Outposts section on the How AWS Pricing Works Whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/how-aws-pricing-works/aws-outposts.html); you have to pay for the service usage no for the capacity. On the repost, it appears the Load Balancer Example. To complement the pricing scheme, you can review [Outposts Pricing Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/rack/pricing/)

**b) What is the procedure of ASG on Outposts ?**
