## Module 6: Containers

**QUESTIONS**:

**a) What is Capacity Provider on ECS?**

R:/ According to Amazon Q:
Capacity Providers in Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) are a feature that allows you to define the compute capacity that your ECS tasks can run on. Here's a summary of how Capacity Providers work:

- **Fargate Capacity Providers:** When using Fargate, the Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity providers are automatically available. You can associate these capacity providers with your ECS cluster to distribute tasks between Fargate on-demand and Fargate Spot instances.

- **EC2 Capacity Providers:** When using EC2 instances, you can create custom capacity providers that are backed by Auto Scaling groups. This allows you to mix different instance types, on-demand and spot instances, and define strategies to distribute tasks among them.

- **Task Distribution:** Capacity providers help you distribute tasks across different compute options. For example, you can define a strategy to run 50% of tasks on Fargate on-demand and 50% on Fargate Spot.

- **Autoscaling Integration:** Capacity providers can be integrated with Auto Scaling groups to enable Cluster Auto Scaling (CAS). This allows ECS to automatically scale the underlying EC2 capacity based on the number of pending tasks.

- **Managed Scaling and Draining:** Capacity providers offer features like managed scale-in protection and managed draining to ensure graceful handling of instance termination and task migrations.

- **Troubleshooting:** If you encounter scaling issues with your capacity providers, you can check factors like service association, scaling policy configuration, task placement strategy, and Auto Scaling group issues.

For the most up-to-date information on Capacity Providers, pricing, limits, and other details, please refer to the [Amazon ECS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-capacity-provider-console-v2.html).


**a) What is EKS Anywhere?**
R:/ I have to correct myself, because I thought it was a Kubernetes operator for multicloud and hybrid environments; however it applies for hybrid environments ONLY, when you have on-premises resources and you like to manage using AWS Console.

## Module 8: High Availability and DDoS

**QUESTIONS**:

**a) Are there any pricing difference between Global WAF deployment (for Cloudfront) and Regional WAF Deployment (ELB, API Gateway and others) ?**

R:/ No, according to [AWS WAF Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/), it says: "You will be charged for each web ACL that you create and each rule that you create per web ACL". Therefore, you are charging by ACL, rules and rule type (Bot Control and Fraud control), please check the page to have a better perspective.

**a) What are the coverage of Firewall Manager ? Includes Network Firewall?**

R:/ Yes, it includes Network Firewall and others like: AWS WAF rules, AWS Shield Advanced protections, VPC security groups, VPC network access control lists (ACLs) and Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rules across multiple AWS accounts and resources from a single place.
